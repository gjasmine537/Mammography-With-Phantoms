# Mammography-With-Phantoms
To address a solution to the competitive market, this mammography project proposes a MATLAB-based solution that leverages the concept of a digital twin to simulate a conventional mammography system.

The following Mammography Project includes 3 .m files as well as a single .mlapp file. To test the project, you will have to download/save the code files. Then, open the file that says Medical_Imaging_GUI.mlapp. This will open MATLAB for the user, while also showing the GUI for the project. Now, the user will be able to adjust the parameters for either a 2D or 3D phantom. When you have the parameters you want, just click the button at the bottom to confirm, and the user is prompted to the output image.

*Disclaimer: When viewing the 3D Phantom, the 2D Image of the 3D Phantom is shown on top of it. So, it is best to click and move the window for the 2D image to the side to view the 3D Phantom. *

*Make sure you have MATLAB installed to run the Project! *
